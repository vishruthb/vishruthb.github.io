Welcome to my little patch of the internet.

I'm currently at student at UC Santa Cruz with a passion for computer science. I have worked extensively with advanced algorithms and competed in the [USA Computing Olympiad](http://www.usaco.org/index.php) Gold Division, and Iâ€™m guided by my belief that enthusiasm is one of the best sources of motivation. In my
spare time, I like tinkering with projects, such as competing in [hackathons](https://devpost.com/vishruthbharath), making this website, and building 
[Dermahub](http://dermahub.org/).

I also enjoy good music, attempting to cook food, hiking, and playing poker.
